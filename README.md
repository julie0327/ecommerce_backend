## Project Specifications
A functional Express.js API
* When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* When I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* When I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
